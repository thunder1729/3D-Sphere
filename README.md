# 3D-Sphere

This is my first ThreeJS project that animates a Sphere in 3D space. You can change the color with hex colors. I used visual studio to make this project but you can use any editor. To run the project type the following in the terminal.

```
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```



This is the final product of the sphere.
